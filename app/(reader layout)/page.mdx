Hi, my name is Zen! This space is currently under construction. WIP - home on the internet.

Sorting → Many of you told us that the most vibrant comments and discussions should be the first thing people see. Now, there's an option to sort comments by best, newest, and oldest first — with best (measured by likes) as the default.

Call to action at the top → An invitation to join the discussion now sits at the top of the comments section, helping to convert new readers into members, and free members into paying subscribers.

Plus, hitting the ❤️ or Reply button now prompts readers to sign up or upgrade to leave a comment.

Hidden and deleted comments → Comments without replies will now disappear entirely when hidden or deleted. No more annoying placeholders.
