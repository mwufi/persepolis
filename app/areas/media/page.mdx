[Edges](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/43483913-edges) by Linda Nagata - Just started this one! The premise is interesting, the writing is good, and I'm looking forward to seeing what happens as they go on their little voyage..


# Watching

[Nirvana in Fire 2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nirvana_in_Fire_2) - For some reason, after watching a lot of Chinese dramas, I find that they're quite different from any other show, with no equivalent in Western media. I suppose the only equivalent would be something like Game of Thrones: long, unfolding over 40 episodes, with relatable characters who try the best they can, acting in their own right interests, leading to a show that's partly about the characters and partly about fate; watching the dramas unfold just like in real life.
