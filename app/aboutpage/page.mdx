# About

I believe the world can be a beautiful place when we decide to make it so.

Currently running an independent design practice in Toronto. I'm also pursuing a Bachelor of Information at UofT, where I'm exploring at the intersection of technology and culture.

Previously, I've designed public tools for the Ontario government, startup e-commerce experiences, and COVID-19 data dashboards. I studied biomedical engineering at UWaterloo and left to bet on myself in sophomore year. I've since worked as a chief of staff at a multinational design company, travelled the world, and found a deep appreciation for life.
