- **World class investors:** We're backed by Keith Rabois from Khosla Ventures alongside Nat Friedman, Daniel Gross and many leaders from the ML and fintech community. Check out our announcement for an expansive list

- **Extremely fast growth:** We've partnered with some of the largest accounting firms in the world, with revenue 10x-ing over the last 5 months

- **Be part of building a company:** We're scaling the team fast and the business faster, meaning there will always be more responsibility than we have people. No better place to get a ton of responsibility and ownership on day 1

- **In person & interdisciplinary:** We operate on the frontier of what's technically possible. That is why being in-person is a must. We're bringing together the brightest minds from the top engineering, ML, and accounting teams to work together in our NYC office and build production quality agentic systems

- **High risk:** We believe the world is about to change in profound ways. We are building Basis to be on the cutting-edge of that change for a decade to come, and we have an appetite for the risk that comes with that. The journey has just begun

- **Compensation:** We aim to pay competitively for cash compensation and well above market for equity compensation because the whole team is all-in, and we want you to be too
