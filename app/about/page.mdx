# About Me

I need to put more pictures on here.

**Funny how we call it *bio*, huh?** Almost like we're wet blob creatures, writing about ourselves.

Areas of interest:
- AI - See more [thoughts on ai](/areas/ai)
- Entrepreneurship - I think not in the traditional sense, more like the stories of "how do you start something cool?". Some of my favorite entrepreneurship stories include: Sara Blakely putting shelves of her product in stores, and no one removing it bc each manager thought another manager had authorized it; Guy who started Athletic Brewing Co (makes non-alcoholic beer) and no one buys it, or even wants to work with him
- Investing - Love to connect to people who have a vision and want to make a difference (DM me on Twitter!)
