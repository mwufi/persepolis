Oh boy, how do I get started?

### Favorite AI tools (currently)

- [Midjourney](https://www.midjourney.com/)
    - I'm a big fan of this one, bc it's fun! I think the one thing is, I'd love a better discovery mechanism. Also text controllability is a nice thing. But overall the quality you can get is *amazing*, and I'm glad I pay for this one
- [Claude](https://claude.ai/)
    - Just a casual user of it, mostly to summarize things, generate ideas, and more! Would love to compare notes & see how YOU use AI
- [Hailuo AI](https://hailuoai.video/)
    - I've been meaning to play with video generation more. But it's so crazy that you can generate really good video. there's ton more, like [Runway](https://runwayml.com/), Hunyuan video, 


### Tools I haven't explored
- Image generation: Ideogram, Red panda
- Video generation - those body sync ones. idk what they're called, but if i wanted to do visual effects it's good knowing they're there!


### Tools I want

- Generate UGC automatically (for tiktok ads). If I can make a tiktok without making a tiktok (something like arcads.ai)... would probably use it!

### Philosophy of AI

**Is AI going to kill us all? Is superintelligence a threat to human existence?**

Firm NO on both. More AI will probably be cool. 

### Technical AI

Let me write about how gaussian splats are cool. and NeRF
