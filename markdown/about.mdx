# About Me

I need to put more pictures on here.

**Funny how we call it *bio*, huh?** Almost like we're wet blob creatures, writing about ourselves.

I'm a software engineer, AI enthusiast, all around generalist. I love complex problems, reading, and eating food!

### Family life
I grew up in a small state, moved to the best university in the nation (Boola Boola!), and then best nation in the world (Her Majesty's Imperial & United Kingdom, of course), before moving back to NYC. Nowadays, I travel around Bay area/NYC/midwest.
 
 
### Career

- Engineering. What *kind* of engineering, you ask? Social engineering.... 
- Just kidding, I work at [TikTok](https://www.tiktok.com/) as an ML engineer. Recommendations is cool! A lot of people ask: what is recommendations actually *like*? And it turns out that it's pretty simple. [Learn more!](/blog/what-is-recommendation)
- Before that, I worked at [Wayve](https://wayve.ai/) with Alex Kendall, Jeff Hawke, and a bunch of other people. Some of whom have gone on to start [Odyssey](https://odyssey.systems), a really cool generative 3D startup! (did I tell you [gaussian splats are cool?](/areas/ai))


### Areas of interest

- AI - See more [thoughts on ai](/areas/ai)
- Entrepreneurship - I think not in the traditional sense, more like the stories of "how do you start something cool?". Some of my favorite entrepreneurship stories include: Sara Blakely putting shelves of her product in stores, and no one removing it bc each manager thought another manager had authorized it; Guy who started Athletic Brewing Co (makes non-alcoholic beer) and no one buys it, or even wants to work with him
- Investing - Love to connect to people who have a vision and want to make a difference (DM me on Twitter!)
- Crypto - I'm a big fan of crypto! Maybe will write more about it in the future

### Where are we going now?

We're currently in a HUGE opportunity of making AI work for everyone.

So I'm going to start a company called ExXA (EXX AI) to help realize this dream.

My vision is that in 2-3 years, everyone will have ONE personal AI, not just a bunch of super-powerful AI tools. Everyone will have a personal AI, just like how everyone has their smartphone today.

The challenge is making this AI genuinely useful - how? The answer is in being incredibly thoughtful in the integrations we build, and by connecting you with other people -- like the WeChat strategy. AI is powerful when it allows you to connect *better*.
