The idea of this personal site is that it's content-based; minimal, but also cool. In the way that words (carefully selected and laid out) are cool.

> less is more!

## Inspirations

### The name
Persepolis calls to mind classical antiquity. Something remotely foreign. Juxtaposing technology with antiquity, reminding us of the vast expanses of knowledge and un-knowledge, the wilderness and unknown still out there.

Ever heard those sci-fi stories where explorers get themselves in a bit of a pickle, because they find technology older than themselves, or secrets they don't understand? That's what Persepolis is about - this thrill of finding, discovery, clicking links, figuring out the site is more than just a site, exploring bold new opportunities, being inspired, and returning to your own world.

Becoming wiser, encountering the unknown, learning *more* about the unknown, about yourself. It's a grand adventure, and I'm excited to share it with you.

### The experience

Persepolis is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) app that lets you write your entire website in Markdown.

It's actually quite cool -- eventually we'll be able to write our entire site in Markdown, like ([this](/about/example))

The hard part is rendering -- getting the CSS quite right. I like this one for now - simple, elegant, using just the defaults. I played with a lot of fonts, but for some reason I like this one the best. (if you have any font picking tips, [let me know](/collab)!)


### The content

Since it's a personal site, I'm going to try to give it more texture than you'd normally see on the internet. My inspiration is to try to create something *alive* - dynamic, something you can push and pull and interact with.

The first step - adding lots of content, and then ways to relate to that content.

I'm going to add my favorite books and movies, photos of places I've been, photos of places I *haven't* been, and more. Long monologues on technology (crypto? space? bio design? and more), which I hope people will respond to.


### Roadmap

As you can see, checkboxes don't work!

- [ ] Implement custom styling
- [ ] Add syntax highlighting for code blocks
- [ ] Create a table of contents component
- [ ] Optimize images for faster loading
- [ ] Add dark mode support
