How did labour fare in 2024? 

In many ways, the Canadian labour market and labour movement are both looking more like they did pre-pandemic. Hopes of using the relatively robust post-pandemic economy as a springboard to build something better seem to largely be fading. 

Strike activity was down considerably in 2024, after reaching historic heights the previous year, by some measures. Wage growth has cooled, even as unions continue to seek pay increases to account for post-pandemic inflation. While some legislative gains were made this past year, governments also intervened in several important labour actions to end or pre-empt strikes and to come to the aid of employers who locked out their workers. In particular, the federal government has been especially coercive in its use of back-to-work orders. 

Yet workers and unions did also engage in important fights in 2024. 

Early in the year, teachers in Saskatchewan went on strike against the right-wing government of Scott Moe, seeking wage increases and the right to bargain over class sizes, an issue over which teachers’ unions in other provinces already negotiate.   

In late June, mechanics at WestJet struck the airline and later defied a government arbitration order, ultimately winning a considerable 26 per cent wage increase. The WestJet dispute was perhaps one of the most noteworthy examples of union militancy in 2024, though it also proved to be the opening salvo in a series of repressive actions by the Trudeau Liberal government to end work stoppages in the federal jurisdiction. 

The following month, LCBO workers in Ontario engaged in a contentious strike against the Doug Ford government’s plan to further privatize liquor retailing in the province. While the future of the LCBO remains uncertain, workers did manage to secure important job protections. 

In another inspiring case, law professors became the first faculty to unionize at McGill University, but were then forced to wage a months-long struggle to bring the administration to the bargaining table. 

Federal public servants also found themselves engaged in several ongoing battles. Like many other workers, federal government employees continued to resist their employer’s forced return-to-office policy. The Treasury Board has slowly increased the number of required days of in-person work, despite evidence emerging later in the year that the government knew that productivity and worker satisfaction were better under the remote work model. Later in the year, a pension surplus resulted in accusations that the government was stealing workers’ pension contributions. 

Of course, the year concluded with a long strike at Canada Post, which like several other federal work stoppages this year, ended with government intervention and union members being denied their rights to freely bargain and strike. 

If these were some of the major highlights, what do the data on work stoppages and wage settlements reveal?
