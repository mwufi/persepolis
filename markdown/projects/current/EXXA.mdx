> What kind of AI would make your everyday life cooler?

EXXA is an all-in-one assistant. Better than Claude, since it'll know what you're doing.

Think of why you don't use AI today -- too hard. You have to prompt it every time.

But what if the AI *was your computer*? You'd simply tell it, "Book me a flight to Hawaii next week, OK?" And it'll do it.

To get that far, we need to build *flows* - well-defined things that it can do, like browse the web, write emails, and more.

I imagine solving the consumer AI problem to be something like self-driving. Before AGI, we can just start by mapping all the things (like Waymo), measuring edge cases and so forth. Eventually, the things it will be able to do will become more and more, and it'll *feel magical*.
