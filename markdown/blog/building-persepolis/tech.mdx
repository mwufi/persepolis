## What are we building?

### The Ghost Recording idea

Persepolis is a personal site, but I want it to feel *alive*, like you can poke it. 

The most basic analogue is holograms, ghost recordings of people. If I die, I want there to be recordings of me that I can interact with, that can pull on the things I say here, and give some sort of advice.

It's like asking Einstein what he would have done, or asking Confucius what he thinks about things now. The AI would find the relevant sources, nay, better yet, create the best model of the person so that the sources make sense, and then use that model to inform its response.

On the one hand, you *would* be talking to an AI. On the other hand, it's so much better than a static webpage.

## Comments

Comments, or a chatbox, would be a smaller version of that. a 1-1 kind of thing? a 1-many kind of thing?

I suppose the interesting questions about engagement are around: who gets to interact with who, and how?

- Comments section - Everyone reads, 1 person writes
- Live chat - Everyone reads, everyone writes
- Chat with AI - maybe 1 person gets to chat with the website, it's your personal relationship with the content


## Basic things everyone should have! Immediate list

Barebones kitchen essentials!

- **Breadcrumbs** - kinda annoying to go back, huh?
- **Inventory** - navigation would be nice. search would be nice.

- Commenting? live cursors?
- Ability to see the "tree" of content
